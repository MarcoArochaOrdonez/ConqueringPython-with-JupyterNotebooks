# ConqueringPython-with-JupyterNotebooks
Useful interactive Jupyter dashboards. 
This Jupyter Notebook is a new effort by the professor to deliver information about a topic and provide with a programming environment in which by using simple exercises the student can learn python programming. In this interactive environment the professor will include (1) brief information about a topic, and (2) examples of executable python code, and on its side, the student (3) can execute the code and see the outcome. The student can also produce and run its own code. Your code is not evaluated or graded, if it contains errors, will there be (I hope soon the professor's Jupyter notebooks can grade your code) . Everything you do in the Jupyter Notebook, will be automatically saved as you type. There is nothing wrong with leaving code with errors in it, as long as a later time you comeback and commit working to correct them. I hope you to have a nice experience in this environment.
